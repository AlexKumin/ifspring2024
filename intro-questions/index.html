        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Alex, I am a Design Major, and I am a Junior</p>
        <p>2. My background is more in the physical realm as I like to use my hands, like in sculpture for example. I took this class because I am also intrigued by graphic and digital design.</p>
        <p>3. I have almost no experience outside of Scratch which I did years ago.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to be competent enough to make my own website without having to use wix.</p>
        <p>5. The biggest way I think it would be different would be the fact computers don't have eyes. Humans have eyes and they allow our body to have depth of field which allows us to move in a coordinated fashion. However, on a computer you will have to explain every little minute detail because computers have no intuition.</p>
        <p>6. I really enjoy the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5">Unreal Engine 5</a> website. The animations are stellar and the layout is concise and direct. Additonally, I really love the font and color choices. There also aren't any dropdown bars or menus because its informational and visual, rather than super practical. However, given the purpose of UR5 this makes total sense.</p>
        <p>7. Weirdly I think that the <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/">TSA</a> website is quite effective. While we all think that the lines are too long, its important that people understand what is and isn't okay to fly with. As a result, it is imperative that the website and visual layout of the information itself is clear and foolproof. I think they've made it that way. The website is intuitive and straightforward. The menus and dropdowns are obvious and effective. </p>
        <p>8. I both love the product and website for <a href="https://www.ableton.com/">Ableton</a>. The software is a DAW or Digital Audio Workspace and is used for music production. The software has a particular feel and look to it, and something that is really cool is how the website matches and mimics the aesthetic of the software itself. The website is also incredibly informative providing free instructional videos, relevant products, development updates, forums, and licensed samples for music as well. It does exactly what it needs to do, but goes above and beyond. Having worked in the software for years now, the website is actually one of its biggest highlights. </p>
